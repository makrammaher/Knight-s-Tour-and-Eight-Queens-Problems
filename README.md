# Knight-s-Tour-and-Eight-Queens-Problems
C Program to solve Knight’s Tour and Eight Queens problems on 8x8 Chess board. Using Brute-Force Approach and Accessibility-Heuristic Approach and Exhaustive Approch to solve each problem.

## **Knight Tour Problem**
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open

### **Brute-Force Approach**
- it takes long time to solve the problem.
- it takes 3345625 tries to solve it.

### **Accessibility-Heuristic Approach**
- Solves the problem in no time.
- I put in some delay to be able to see it.

## **Eight Queen Problem**
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are **92** solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century.
